# Introduction about me 
### my name is raghad nedal narmouq, I joined a software engineering course because my dream is to be a full stack developer, and its interesting field and has a future, my hobbies are sports of all kinds, especially swimming, cycling, badminton and yoga

##### We learn in this lecture about a lot of things.
- first the difference between the GUI and CLI, which GUI is lets the user interact with the device/ system with the help of graphical elements, like windows, menus, icon,...etc, and the CUI its let a user interact withdevice/system with the help of the various command and its better than GUI as a programmer.
- And we learn about the command structure, and command examples like, ls (list), cleae, mkdir (to make directory(create folder)), touch (to create file), cat (to show the content in a specific file), mv (to relocate the specific file from place to another place or change the file name), cd (to change directory), cd.. (to get back one step), and cd../.. (to get back two steps).
- And we learn about Version Control System , like github online open source, its a oline cloud backup system, its a repository of files, every change made to the code will be tracked, github saves data even if my computer turns off, we use Repository inside github to store and save my coding projects by this procedure:
    - first you must create a repository by using a version control system called github, and choose a user name you want
    - second you must create a 
    SSH key, its a secure link between my device and my account on github, it has a private key to do authentication, and we do it once for all projects
    - we must access the file created in github by using terminal by copy the code from SSH in the github file and paste it in the termonal (ubuntu)
    - then we must change the directory to the file reguired in the github by ==>> cd (file required) and we now have a directory repository named (file required) inside my github username
    - then we move to vs code by ==>> code .
    and then we can edit anything in this code 
    - after any editing we should add this command ==>> git add .  (to add the eddit)
    - and we can add comment to show the what we change in the code by command ==>> git commit -m "the comment" 
    - then you push the edit by the command ==>> git push origin main 
    the main is the branch name
    origin is the SSH key
